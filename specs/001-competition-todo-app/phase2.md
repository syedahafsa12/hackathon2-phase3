Phase II: Todo Full-Stack Web Application
Basic Level Functionality
Objective: Using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus transform the console app into a modern multi-user web application with persistent storage.
💡Development Approach: Use the Agentic Dev Stack workflow: Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code. No manual coding allowed. We will review the process, prompts, and iterations to judge each phase and project.
Requirements
Implement all 5 Basic Level features as a web application
Create RESTful API endpoints
Build responsive frontend interface
Store data in Neon Serverless PostgreSQL database
Authentication – Implement user signup/signin using Better Auth

Securing the REST API
Better Auth + FastAPI Integration
The Challenge
Better Auth is a JavaScript/TypeScript authentication library that runs on your Next.js frontend. However, your FastAPI backend is a separate Python service that needs to verify which user is making API requests.
The Solution: JWT Tokens
Better Auth can be configured to issue JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens when users log in. These tokens are self-contained credentials that include user information and can be verified by any service that knows the secret key.
How It Works
User logs in on Frontend → Better Auth creates a session and issues a JWT token
Frontend makes API call → Includes the JWT token in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header
Backend receives request → Extracts token from header, verifies signature using shared secret
Backend identifies user → Decodes token to get user ID, email, etc. and matches it with the user ID in the URL
Backend filters data → Returns only tasks belonging to that user
What Needs to Change
Component
Changes Required
Better Auth Config
Enable JWT plugin to issue tokens
Frontend API Client
Attach JWT token to every API request header
FastAPI Backend
Add middleware to verify JWT and extract user
API Routes
Filter all queries by the authenticated user's ID

The Shared Secret
Both frontend (Better Auth) and backend (FastAPI) must use the same secret key for JWT signing and verification. This is typically set via environment variable BETTER_AUTH_SECRET in both services.
Security Benefits
Benefit
Description
User Isolation
Each user only sees their own tasks
Stateless Auth
Backend doesn't need to call frontend to verify users
Token Expiry
JWTs expire automatically (e.g., after 7 days)
No Shared DB Session
Frontend and backend can verify auth independently

API Behavior Change
After Auth:
All endpoints require valid JWT token
Requests without token receive 401 Unauthorized
Each user only sees/modifies their own tasks
Task ownership is enforced on every operation

Bottom Line
The REST API endpoints stay the same (GET /api/user_id/tasks, POST /api/user_id/tasks, etc.), but every request now must include a JWT token, and all responses are filtered to only include that user's data.


Monorepo Organization For Full-Stack Projects With GitHub Spec-Kit + Claude Code
This guide explains how to organize your Full-Stack Projects in a monorepo to integrate GitHub Spec-Kit for spec-driven development with Claude Code. This guide explains how to organize your repository so that Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus can effectively edit both frontend (Next.js) and backend (FastAPI) code in a single context.

# Todo App - Hackathon II
 
## Project Overview
This is a monorepo using GitHub Spec-Kit for spec-driven development.
 
## Spec-Kit Structure
Specifications are organized in /specs:
- /specs/overview.md - Project overview
- /specs/features/ - Feature specs (what to build)
- /specs/api/ - API endpoint and MCP tool specs
- /specs/database/ - Schema and model specs
- /specs/ui/ - Component and page specs
 
## How to Use Specs
1. Always read relevant spec before implementing
2. Reference specs with: @specs/features/task-crud.md
3. Update specs if requirements change
 
## Project Structure
- /frontend - Next.js 14 app
- /backend - Python FastAPI server
 
## Development Workflow
1. Read spec: @specs/features/[feature].md
2. Implement backend: @backend/CLAUDE.md
3. Implement frontend: @frontend/CLAUDE.md
4. Test and iterate
 
## Commands
- Frontend: cd frontend && npm run dev
- Backend: cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload
- Both: docker-compose up
Frontend CLAUDE.md
# Frontend Guidelines
 
## Stack
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
 
## Patterns
- Use server components by default
- Client components only when needed (interactivity)
- API calls go through `/lib/api.ts`
 
## Component Structure
- `/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/app` - Pages and layouts
 
## API Client
All backend calls should use the api client:
 
import { api } from '@/lib/api'
const tasks = await api.getTasks()
 
## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- No inline styles
- Follow existing component patterns

Backend CLAUDE.md
# Backend Guidelines
 
## Stack
- FastAPI
- SQLModel (ORM)
- Neon PostgreSQL
 
## Project Structure
- `main.py` - FastAPI app entry point
- `models.py` - SQLModel database models
- `routes/` - API route handlers
- `db.py` - Database connection
 
## API Conventions
- All routes under `/api/`
- Return JSON responses
- Use Pydantic models for request/response
- Handle errors with HTTPException
 
## Database
- Use SQLModel for all database operations
- Connection string from environment variable: DATABASE_URL
 
## Running
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

/specs/api/rest-endpoints.md
# REST API Endpoints
 
## Base URL
- Development: http://localhost:8000
- Production: https://api.example.com
 
## Authentication

/specs/database/schema.md
# Database Schema
 
## Tables
 
### users (managed by Better Auth)
- id: string (primary key)
- email: string (unique)
- name: string
- created_at: timestamp
 
### tasks
- id: integer (primary key)
- user_id: string (foreign key -> users.id)
- title: string (not null)
- description: text (nullable)
- completed: boolean (default false)
- created_at: timestamp
- updated_at: timestamp
 
## Indexes
- tasks.user_id (for filtering by user)
- tasks.completed (for status filtering)

Workflow with Spec-KitPlus + Claude Code
Write/Update Spec → @specs/features/new-feature.md
Ask Claude Code to Implement → "Implement @specs/features/new-feature.md"
Claude Code reads: Root CLAUDE.md, Feature spec, API spec, Database spec, Relevant CLAUDE.md
Claude Code implements in both frontend and backend
Test and iterate on spec if needed
Referencing Specs in Claude Code

Key Point: 
Spec-Kit Plus provides organized, structured specs that Claude Code can reference. The CLAUDE.md files tell Claude Code how to use those specs and project-specific conventions.

Summary: Monorepo vs Separate Repos
Approach
Pros
Cons
Monorepo ⭐
Single CLAUDE.md context, easier cross-cutting changes
Larger repo
Separate Repos
Clear separation, independent deployments
Claude Code needs workspace setup

Recommendation: 
Use monorepo for the hackathon – simpler for Claude Code to navigate and edit both frontend and backend in a single context.
