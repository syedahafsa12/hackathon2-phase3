Phase IV: Local Kubernetes Deployment (Minikube, Helm Charts, kubectl-ai, Kagent, Docker Desktop, and Gordon)
Cloud Native Todo Chatbot with Basic Level Functionality
Objective: Deploy the Todo Chatbot on a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube, Helm Charts.
💡Development Approach: Use the Agentic Dev Stack workflow: Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code. No manual coding allowed. We will review the process, prompts, and iterations to judge each phase and project.
Requirements
Containerize frontend and backend applications (Use Gordon)
Use Docker AI Agent (Gordon) for AI-assisted Docker operations
Create Helm charts for deployment (Use kubectl-ai and/or kagent to generate)
Use kubectl-ai and kagent for AI-assisted Kubernetes operations
Deploy on Minikube locally

Note: If Docker AI (Gordon) is unavailable in your region or tier, use standard Docker CLI commands or ask Claude Code to generate the docker run commands for you.

AIOps
Use Docker AI Agent (Gordon) for intelligent Docker operations:
# To know its capabilities
docker ai "What can you do?"

Enable Gordon: Install latest Docker Desktop 4.53+, go to Settings > Beta features, and toggle it on.

Use kubectl-ai, and Kagent for intelligent Kubernetes operations:
# Using kubectl-ai
kubectl-ai "deploy the todo frontend with 2 replicas"
kubectl-ai "scale the backend to handle more load"
kubectl-ai "check why the pods are failing"
 
# Using kagent
kagent "analyze the cluster health"
kagent "optimize resource allocation"

Starting with kubectl-ai will make you feel empowered from day one. Layer in Kagent for advanced use cases. Pair them with Minikube for zero-cost learning and work.

Research Note: Using Blueprints for Spec-Driven Deployment
Can Spec-Driven Development be used for infrastructure automation, and how we may need to use blueprints powered by Claude Code Agent Skills.
